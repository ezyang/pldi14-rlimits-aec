This folder contains code for our Happstack patch.  This actually comes
in two parts.  The first part is an unpatched, latest version of Happstack,
and a short exploit which OOM's the server.  The second part is a patched
version of Happstack, and a httperf benchmark for testing the overhead
of rapidly spawning resource containers.
