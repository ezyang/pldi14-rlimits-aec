This folder contains code for the prisoner's dilemma example.
It's implemented two ways: once using the raw resource limits API
exposed by GHC (PrisonersRaw) and once using the resource limits
monad (Prisoners).

Quick Start
-----------

Build with:

    make

You can run with:

    ./Prisoners

To see memory usage over time, run with detailed GC statistics.

    ./Prisoners +RTS -S

Sorry, no automatic graphics this time.  (I made a small patch to the
runtime system to collect this data in a machine-readable format, which
is fiddly to setup.)
