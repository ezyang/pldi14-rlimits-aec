This folder contains code to run the experiments for "Resource limit
accuracy", including generation of graphics.

QUICK START
-----------

The full experiment can be run using:

    make data.pdf

However, this will take a little bit of time.  Impatient people can get
some quick results by running:

    make data.pdf FAST=1

STRUCTURE
---------

Main.hs compiles into 'damp' (don't ask), which is a program which
takes three arguments:

    ./damp TESTNO INPUTSIZE RLIMITPAGES

Test numbers correspond to the following tests:

        0: "retainer",
        1: "opl",
        3: "suml",
        4: "tree",
        5: "small",
        6: "large",
        7: "ghc",
        8: "block",
        9: "megablock"

There are a few more tests here than in the paper, but their outputs
look the same as other tests, so they were omitted.
